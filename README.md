# neatest

Neatest is a collection of the neatest repositories to start your future repos from.

## Why are they the "neatest"?

Each repo is made so it's readily deployable without further modification. So you just have to add your code/business logic and that's it, no more spending time configuring your issue templates, travis, etc.
